Hardened vs Non-Hardened Keys
This relates to Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, where one seed can generate many keys.
●	Non-hardened key (normal derivation)
 The child key can be derived from a parent public key + chain code.
   Meaning  If someone gets your public key and the chain code, they can generate     all child public keys (but not private keys).
  Easier for watch-only wallets.

●	Hardened key (secure derivation)
 The child key requires the parent private key to generate.
  More secure because even if someone gets your extended public key, they can’t derive hardened children.
 Commonly used for the first levels of the key hierarchy (e.g., account level).


Why Deterministic Wallets Are Preferred

Deterministic wallets (like HD wallets) use a single master seed phrase (like your 12–24 word recovery phrase) to generate all keys.
 Benefits:
●	Easy backup: one seed restores all addresses

●	Better privacy: automatically creates new addresses

●	Consistent structure: compatible across wallets

Non-deterministic wallets, on the other hand, generate random keys each time . No link between them  which means:
●	You’d have to back up every private key individually

●	Risk of losing funds if you forget to back up one key

That’s why HD (deterministic) wallets are now the standard for Bitcoin wallets.
